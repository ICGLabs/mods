Step 1 - Determine your installation type
Before you begin the manual steps, determine your Office installation type so you can choose the correct way to uninstall it:

Click-to-Run is a new way to install and update Office over the Internet and it works similarly to streaming video. By default, the latest version of Office which is included in Office 365, and most one-time purchases of Office 2016 products (such as Office Home & Student 2016 or Office Home & Business are installed by using Click-to-Run.

MSI, (also known as the Microsoft Windows Installer), is the traditional way of installing Office via a local installation resource.

To determine your installation type

Open an Office application, such as Outlook or Word.

Go to File > Account or Office Account.

If you see an "Update Options" item, you have a Click-to-Run installation. If you don't see the "Update Options" item, you have an MSI-based install.
