<h1><img src="resources/icon.png"/> Paint.Net</h1>

<code>PaintDotNet3.7z</code> (<code>3.511.4977.23448</code>) and 
<code>PaintDotNet4.7z</code> (<code>4.100.6822.38824</code>).

x86 (32bit) version of Paint.Net program, 
flat-packed with https://github.com/eladkarako/mods/tree/master/7z 
can be run from any folder with <code>PaintDotNet.exe</code>, 
or running <code>PaintDotNet_x86.msi</code> for an installation (will be fast too since it is all unpacked).

Paint.Net will write several registry values on first run.

<hr/>

to extract it yourself get your installation from https://www.getpaint.net/download.html or https://filehippo.com/download_paint.net/ 
extract it with 7zip from https://github.com/eladkarako/mods/tree/master/7z and use use uniExtract 1.6 on the MSI in the folder, 
you may delete folders of the architecture you aren't using.

The DLLs and EXEs are manifest-patched with https://github.com/eladkarako/manifest

<hr/>

<code>Effects.7z</code> and <code>FileTypes.7z</code> from the resources folder, 
both have a lot of effects and filetypes you may use (extract to main folder).

<hr/>

I prefer the 3.5 version.
