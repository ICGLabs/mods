<h1><img src="resources/icon.png"/> Tray Minimizer</h1>
and old version of tray minimizer by 4t Niagara Software,
flat - no installer (it is a freeware).

with manifest files embedded and side-by-side.

you can create a shortcut for the "/t" to run the main exe directly to tray, or my simple 4t-min_tray.exe,
create a shortcut in your startup menu and the settings will be generated on the first run.

you should probably block those domains in your HOSTS file:
