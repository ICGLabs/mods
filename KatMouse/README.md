full program (freeware), flat - no installer.<br/>

will scroll anything without the need to give it focus,<br/>
you can scroll background windows while the main focused-window is a dialog (for example).

You can create a shortcut in <code>"C:\Users\<strong><em>YOUR_USER_NAME</em></strong>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"</code> a shortcut to make it start on every boot.

run it and the first time right click the tray-icon <br/>

if not you can import my settings by closing down KatMouse and running <code>settings.reg</code> from the resources folder.
