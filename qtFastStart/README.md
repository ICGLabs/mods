<h1><img src="resources/icon.png" />qtFastStart</h1>

Quicktime atom positioning in Python for fast streaming, batch-file helper and program.

the folder structure is a little-weird, <br/>
but the batch file fixes it, so all you have to do is to <br/>
drag and drop files over it, or run it from command-line, <br/>
you can include it in other batch files (with <code>call</code>), <br/>
and it will forward the exit-code and output through too.
