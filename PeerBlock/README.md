<h1><img src="resources/icon.png" />PeerBlock</h1>

This is the <code>1.1_r518</code> version from https://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock/files/ 
with several modifications.

the most important one is the ability to get the direct-URL for the classic subscription-lists, for free, 
the other one is a manifest-patch with https://github.com/eladkarako/manifest ,
there is also a newer icon, and a ready to use configuration with useful lists.

<hr/>

the program has some password-protected files, 
mostly the configuration and the NodeJS-script that updates the configuration to the latest direct-URLs.

those are password protected because they are unstable (for now).

<hr/>

You should install PeerBlock (you may use the installer under the resources folder), so it will install the driver, 
make sure the install PeerBlock under <code>C:\PeerBlock\</code> for the batch-scripts to work, 
extract the 7zip files to the same-folder (you need the password naturally...), finally move the files to the PeerBlock installation path, overwriting the old ones.
